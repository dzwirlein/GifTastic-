# Gif_Tastic


Created an app using an API from Giphy. The application populates the DOM with buttons. Each button has a topic id which pulls gifs from Giphy on button click. The application also allows the user to populate new buttons with a search and submit input. The gif images start out static but become active apon mouse click. On page reload the buttons reset to default.
